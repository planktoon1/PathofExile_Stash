# Path of Exile - Stash
Live site: https://elastic-payne-6c7ed2.netlify.com/frontpage

This is a passion project of mine. It is build using React js and Typescript.
I will keep updating it whenever i find time to work on it, i have alot of features in mind, and i'm open to suggestions.
When i started building this site i had never build anything more complex than the tutorials on Reacts website, resulting in alot of the code base not beeing optimal. I do however refactor as i'm building new features.

### Welcome to Stash. A Single page application that is trying to emulate the crafting system of the popular ARpg Path of Exile.

The goal of this tool is to provide an authentic crafting experience that stays true to the game systems as well as providing  
valuable insight into the system, that can help you get better results when crafting in game.  
There is a lot of features that is yet to be implemented, and likely some bugs as well. I would love to hear feature  
suggestions and also about the bugs you encounter, feel free to contact me at:

### Planned features - in order of priority

**( that i'm working on currently, or will work on whenever i have the time. )**

- Item stats

  - Weapons: Dps, Ele. Dps, Phys. Dps, Aps, Crit
  - Armour: Armour, Evasion, Energy Shield.
  - Likely others

- Copy Paste Feature

  - Right now you can CTRL + C while hovering an item in PoE and it will copy a text representation of the item to clipboard.  
    This feature would allow users to paste items into this website and that way get their item in this tool, and then be able to craft  
    and see possible outcomes.
  - Paste into website
  - Copy item from website

- Info buttons that explains some of the less intuitive features, and also how things are calculated

- Master Crafting

  - Add to the manual affix tab
  - Separate tab with costs ( basically same menu as the one you find in game )

- Delve Crafting

  - Add to the manual affix tab
  - Separate tab that allows similar usage of resonators to in game
  - Some way of showing possible outcomes with selected fossils

- Rework base item selection

  - Make it sortable by all columns that makes sense, and also searchable

- Save state in browser so it's not lost on refresh

  - With this i will also look into making an undo feature

- Bestiary Crafting
  - When everything else is done i'll start thinking about this
