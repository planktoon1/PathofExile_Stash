# Path of Exile - Stash

Live site: [poestash.netlify.app](https://poestash.netlify.app/frontpage)

This is a passion project of mine. It is build using React js and Typescript.
When i started building this site i had never build anything more complex than the tutorials on Reacts website, resulting in alot of the code base not beeing optimal.

### Welcome to Stash. A Single page application that is trying to emulate the crafting system of the popular ARpg Path of Exile.

_This is a very outdated project, the game data is 4+ years old and therefore not accurate at all_

The goal of this tool is to provide an authentic crafting experience that stays true to the game systems as well as providing  
valuable insight into the system, that can help you get better results when crafting in game.
