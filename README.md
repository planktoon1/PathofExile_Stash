# Path of Exile - Stash

Live site: https://elastic-payne-6c7ed2.netlify.com/frontpage (Might take a while to spin up if no one has visited recently)

This is a passion project of mine. It is build using React js and Typescript.
I will keep updating it whenever i find time to work on it, i have alot of features in mind, and i'm open to suggestions.
When i started building this site i had never build anything more complex than the tutorials on Reacts website, resulting in alot of the code base not beeing optimal. I do however refactor as i'm building new features.

### Welcome to Stash. A Single page application that is trying to emulate the crafting system of the popular ARpg Path of Exile.

The goal of this tool is to provide an authentic crafting experience that stays true to the game systems as well as providing  
valuable insight into the system, that can help you get better results when crafting in game.  
There is a lot of features that is yet to be implemented, and likely some bugs as well. I would love to hear feature  
suggestions and also about the bugs you encounter, feel free to contact me at:
